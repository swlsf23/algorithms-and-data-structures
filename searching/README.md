# Searching Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various searching algorithms in multiple languages.

## Algorithms

- [Binary Search](./binary-search/) - Search algorithm for sorted arrays

## Adding New Algorithms

When adding a new searching algorithm:
1. Create a new subdirectory with the algorithm name (e.g., `linear-search/`)
2. Create language subfolders: `java/`, `python/`, `cpp/`, `c/`
3. Add a README.md in the algorithm directory
4. Update this README with a link to the new algorithm
