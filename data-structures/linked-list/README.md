# Linked List

This directory contains implementations of a linked list data structure in multiple languages.

## Implementations

- [Java](./java/)
- [Python](./python/)
- [C++](./cpp/)
- [C](./c/)

## Operations

- Insert
- Delete
- Search
- Traverse

## Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Insert at beginning | O(1) node-based, O(n) array-based | O(1) |
| Insert at end | O(n) node-based, O(1) amortized array-based | O(1) |
| Insert at index | O(n) | O(1) |
| Delete/Remove at beginning | O(1) node-based, O(n) array-based | O(1) |
| Delete/Remove at end | O(n) node-based, O(1) array-based | O(1) |
| Delete/Remove at index | O(n) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(1) |
| Traverse | O(n) | O(1) |
